🧠 Pneumonia Detection System using Deep Learning

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. It automates diagnosis by analyzing medical images and classifying them as Normal or Pneumonia, supporting early detection and faster clinical decisions.

🩻 Overview

Pneumonia remains one of the leading causes of death globally, especially in children and the elderly. Traditional diagnosis through X-rays requires expert interpretation and time. This AI-based system provides an efficient, reliable, and automated method for screening pneumonia cases using deep learning.
